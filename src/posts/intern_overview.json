Some of the most important tasks that Interns complete include curriculum development, cold emailing, interviewing, marketing work, and more. Interns are assigned to work on a specific task in 8-week cycles, and can choose from a variety of tasks. Interns at Robotics for All also help with two other branches of our organization, [Tutoring For All](https://www.tutoringforall.org/) and [Mentoring For All](https://www.mentoringforall.org/). Although unpaid, interns will gain valuable insight into how a growing startup nonprofit organization runs. High school and college students are welcome to apply.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->",
