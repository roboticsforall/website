      "course_description": "**Overview**\n\n* Fundamentals of Programming with Code.org is designed to be an entry level programming course for all K-1st graders. \n* Students will be introduced to block-based coding through lessons from Code.org, an organization that runs a popular platform for learning programming. \n\n**Who should take this course?**\n\n*  K-1st graders. \n\n  * Unless K-1st graders have extensive experience with Code.org, they should take this course.\n\n**Who shouldn’t take this course?**\n\n* 2nd-3rd Graders.\n\n  * These students should take Basic Scratch Part 1 (2-3).\n* 4th Graders and above.\n\n  * Other entry-level courses exist for older students, such as Scratch (4-6), HTML/CSS (6-8), Python (6-8).\n\n**Topics Overview**\n\n* Digital Citizenship\n* Sequencing\n* Loops\n* Events\n* Binary\n* Conditionals\n\n**Class Structure**\n\n1. First class meeting: 1 hour video call (Monday or Tuesday)\n2. Second class meeting: 1 hour video call (Thursday or Friday)\n\n**Curriculum Goals**\n\n* Students will be introduced to the foundations of programming and computer science through fun activities that combine critical thinking and creative application. \n* Students should be ready to transition to Basic Scratch Pt 1 (2-3).\n\n**Required Materials**\n\n* Paper and a writing utensil (pen or pencil) will also occasionally be used for various activities. \n\n  * Students should have these materials ready for each class, although they will not be used in every class.",

      "course_description": "**Overview**\n\n* Basic Scratch Pt 1 (2-3) is designed for 2nd-3rd grade students. \n* This is a two-part 16 week course (two 8 week courses). While you can only register for one part at a time, it is highly recommended that students take both 8 week courses. \n* Students will receive a basic introduction to Scratch, a visual block-based programming language. It is a popular way to learn the logic behind programming and is the perfect stepping stone to more advanced written coding languages such as Python and Java.\n\n  * In this course, students will learn the basics of coding with Scratch, including basic move functions and intermediate level if-then statements. \n\n**Who should take this course?**\n\n* 2nd-3rd Graders. \n\n  * This course is designed for beginners in Scratch. \n\n**Who shouldn’t take this course?**\n\n* K-1st Graders\n\n  * This curriculum is too fast for K-1st graders. We recommend  Fundamentals of Programming with Code.org (K-1).\n*  K-3rd Graders with extensive prior experience in Scratch.\n\n  * This is still a beginner entry-level course, so these students might find it too simple. \n  * Parents and students should reference the concepts list below as well as the concepts list for the Basic Scratch Pt 2 (2-3) course. If they only know concepts taught in Basic Scratch Pt 1 (2-3), they should take Basic Scratch Pt 2 (2-3). \n* 4th Graders and above.\n\n  * Older students without programming experience are should take Scratch (4-6), HTML/CSS (5-8), or Python (6-8).\n\n**Topic Overview**\n\n* Sprites and Stages\n* Motion Blocks\n* Sound and Appearance Blocks\n* Events\n* Loops and If-Then Statements\n* Basic Sensors\n\n**Class Structure**\n\n1. First class meeting: 1 hour video call.\n2. Homework (30 minutes)\n3. Second class meeting: 1 hour video call.\n4. Homework (30 minutes)\n\n**Curriculum Goals**\n\n* Students should be able to program a basic program in Scratch, using motion, sound, appearance, and loop blocks. \n* Students should be ready to take the Basic Scratch Pt 2 (2-3) course.​ ​",
