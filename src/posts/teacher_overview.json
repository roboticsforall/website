  "scheduling": "We start class sessions periodically (usually every few months). At the start of each session, accepted teachers may choose to volunteer in the class session. Although we do our best to administer classes efficiently, they are given based on teacher availability, position, and class interest. For that reason, it can take some time to get a class.\\n\\nClasses run on either a Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday schedule, with times ranging from roughly 2:00 pm Pacific Time to 6:00 pm Pacific Time (5:00 pm Eastern Time to 9:00 pm Eastern Time).",
  "tasks": "* Teach students in synchronous classes \n* Manage any Teacher Assistants \n* Post and review homework assignments\n* Email and respond to emails from parents\n* Answer student questions in a timely manner",
